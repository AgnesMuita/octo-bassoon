    Science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) fields are often dominated by men. Through an intensive
    mentorship program, this project set out to promote and encourage secondary school students in Kenya to choose science
    career pathways and stay within the sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
    Tech EQUIP Kenya(TEK) seeks to provide STEM opportunities for female students and professionals in Kenya. TEK enables girls
    and women to build connections in the STEM field through discussions, field-work, and mentoring. These efforts not only
    add value to each individualâ€™s career, but the STEM projects undertaken also contribute to the alleviation of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
    TEK is a program specifically for young women in the field of Science and
    Technology. This includes students and young professionals. The program is implemented by STEM Africa which aims to
    provide young people in Africa with opportunities and an enabling environment to pursue rich and fulfilling careers and
    enterprises in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths.
    </p>
    <p>
    Working with students: TEK seeks to raise engagement and increase the profile of Science and Technology among young girls. TEK visits girls schools across Kenya to create awareness of and interest in STEM careers, aiming to increase the number of women taking up careers in STEM. At universities they speak at STEM
    events and encourage female enrollment.
